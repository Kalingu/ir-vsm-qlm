Today, companies like Air Canada, Dish Network, and U.S. Bank use the platform for their customer service needs. At its annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, the company has now announced a number of updates to Connect which, unsurprisingly, focus on AI, powered by the Amazon Q platform. &#8220;When we first came out, we were really a voice-only solution that focused heavily on bringing AI to the contact center [with] scalability, security &#8212; the things that are our calling cards for AWS. And pretty quickly, we were able to add more features and get to a bigger feature completeness,&#8221; Pasquale DeMaio, vice president and general manager of Amazon Connect at AWS, told me. &#8220;Now, we offer channels across everything from chat, email &#8212; coming out as we speak &#8212; and also SMS, WhatsApp, Apple Messaging for Business.&#8221; DeMaio stressed that AWS built Connect as an end-to-end solution that is now in use by over 14,000 external customers, as well as Amazon.com itself. Given the contact center context, most of the new features focus on how Connect customers can more easily build AI-powered self-service workflows that can handle many of the more routine customer service tasks. Originally, AWS used Q in Connect mostly to help guide agents through their customer interactions. Now, businesses can use the service to build customer-facing self-service experiences as well. Image Credits:AWS To ensure these external-facing conversations don&#8217;t go off track, AWS allows businesses to set customized guardrails to keep the conversations on track, reduce hallucinations, and help the bots adhere to a company&#8217;s preset policies. Ideally, all of this frees the human agents to focus on higher-value and more complex interactions, DeMaio noted. And talking about those human agents, Connect is also launching new AI-powered agent evaluation tools that the company says will &#8220;enable customer service managers to easily spot performance trends, enhance training, and help improve overall service quality.&#8221; What&#8217;s maybe even more interesting here, though &#8212; and something you may see pop up as a customer calling into a call center soon &#8212; is that AWS is trying to use all of this data and generative AI to help businesses be more proactive in their customer interactions.

San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 REGISTER NOW &#8220;I think the best customer service is often proactive, not always, but often proactive,&#8221; DeMaio said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s been sorely lacking over time, because it has been hard [&#8230;] but if it&#8217;s gotten right, it really can be terrific.&#8221; With this release of Connect, the team built tools to help businesses track what&#8217;s happening with customers in real time (maybe a flight is delayed, a package is stuck in transit, or a subscription is about to renew), segment them into different groups, and then reach out proactively on the most appropriate channel. Ideally that&#8217;s a better customer experience, but it also reduces the number of times customers have to contact the company, which will likely save the business money in the long run. Image Credits:AWS All of this is typically powered by integrating a number of disparate systems with Amazon Q Business. Sometimes that also goes the other way around, with third-party customers building AWS Connect into their contact center solutions. Salesforce, for example, is launching the &#8220;Salesforce Contact Center with Amazon Connect&#8221; today, which integrated Amazon Connect&#8217;s core capabilities with unified routing into Salesforce&#8217;s CRM solution. &#8220;Companies can now use a single routing and workflow solution for their Amazon Connect and Salesforce channels to intelligently deliver calls, chats, email, and cases to the right self-service or agent interaction,&#8221; AWS explains. It&#8217;s worth noting that AWS is aware that not every Connect customer is ready to use generative AI just yet. &#8220;When I talk to customers in the real world who are trying to do this, their big thing is: please stop trying to ram [generative] AI down my throat for every solution,&#8221; DeMaio said. &#8220;We want to help you go at your own pace and do it the right way for your business, and be able to use it for the things where it&#8217;s useful but rely on other technologies that already work great. And I will say, there&#8217;s even situations where a touch tone is still as good or better than voice, like if you ask me to enter my credit card number.&#8221;"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"AWS launches an incident response service to combat cybersecurity threats","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/01/aws-launches-an-incident-response-service-to-combat-cybersecurity-threats/","mainEntityOfPage":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/01/aws-launches-an-incident-response-service-to-combat-cybersecurity-threats/","datePublished":"2024-12-02T04:00:00+00:00","dateModified":"2024-12-04T07:15:35+00:00","publisher":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","inLanguage":"en-US","@id":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/01/aws-launches-an-incident-response-service-to-combat-cybersecurity-threats/#primaryimage","url":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1244447940-e1715711500662.jpg","contentUrl":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1244447940-e1715711500662.jpg","width":1920,"height":1081,"caption":"AWS logo seen at the Web Summit in Lisbon."},"author":[{"id":"https://techcrunch.com/author/kyle-wiggers/#/schema/person/","@type":"Person","name":"Kyle Wiggers","url":"https://techcrunch.com/author/kyle-wiggers/"}],"articleBody":"Companies often struggle with how to respond to cybersecurity incidents. According to one recent poll, only three out of five organizations have an incident response plan in place, and only around a third do regular drills to ensure that their plans remain effective. The consequences of poor incident response are costly. The International Monetary Fund estimates that cyberattacks will cost the world more than $23 trillion by 2027, up from roughly $8.4 trillion in 2022. It&#8217;s against this backdrop that Amazon sensed an opportunity. Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company&#8217;s cloud computing division, launched AWS Security Incident Response, a service that aims to reduce the time it takes for a business to recover from a cyberattack . Hart Rossman, VP of global services security at AWS, told TechCrunch that the new service is designed to help security teams combat account takeovers, breaches, ransomware attacks, and other corporate intrusions along these lines. &#8220;We&#8217;ve received feedback from customers that implementing effective security incident response programs is challenging due to a reliance on various tools, services, and people that are difficult to scale as organizations and business needs evolve,&#8221; he said. &#8220;AWS Security Incident Response can now be used as a [&#8230;] single source of truth for security incident response.&#8221; AWS Security Incident Response automatically triages ﬁndings from Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon&#8217;s threat detection service, and supported third-party cybersecurity tools. From a dashboard with integrated messaging and data transfer modules, customers can adjust the alert settings and account permissioning, and review active incidents, historical data, and metrics like the average time it takes to resolve an incident.

San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 REGISTER NOW Customers can enable the proactive incident response feature, which creates service-level permissions allowing Security Incident Response to monitor and investigate findings &#8230; These findings are automatically sorted and remediated using a combination of automated services and customer-specific data, including common IP addresses &#8230; For any findings that cannot be remediated, Security Incident Response will create a security case which will notify the appropriate stakeholders within the customer&#8217;s organization. In this respect, AWS Security Incident Response isn&#8217;t all that different from the products countless incident response startups have on offer. To name a few, there&#8217;s FireHydrant, Rootly, and the more unique Incident.io, which functions almost entirely within Slack. So what differentiates AWS&#8217; tool? Well, Rossman says, for one, it includes support from AWS&#8217; dedicated customer incident response team. (Customers can choose to handle incidents themselves or interoperate with third-party vendors and partners, however.) There&#8217;s also the fact that AWS Security Incident Response may simply be the most convenient option for companies already relying on other AWS security solutions. &#8220;AWS Security Incident Response works with all AWS detection and response services,&#8221; Rossman said, &#8220;by continuously identifying and prioritizing security issues.&#8221; AWS Security Incident Response is generally available today via the AWS management console and service-specific APIs. Amazon says that customers including the PGA Tour plan to deploy it. Should Amazon make a dent with AWS Security Incident Response, it could be quite lucrative for the tech giant. According to market analytics firm Verified Market Research, the global incident response market could grow from $21.61 billion last year to $89.09 billion by 2030."},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"AWS opens physical outlets that let customers upload their data","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/01/aws-opens-physical-locations-for-customers-to-upload-their-data/","mainEntityOfPage":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/01/aws-opens-physical-locations-for-customers-to-upload-their-data/","datePublished":"2024-12-02T07:09:25+00:00","dateModified":"2024-12-03T00:07:19+00:00","publisher":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","inLanguage":"en-US","@id":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/01/aws-opens-physical-locations-for-customers-to-upload-their-data/#primaryimage","url":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_3870.jpg","contentUrl":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_3870.jpg","width":7192,"height":5394,"caption":"aws logo"},"author":[{"id":"https://techcrunch.com/author/kyle-wiggers/#/schema/person/","@type":"Person","name":"Kyle Wiggers","url":"https://techcrunch.com/author/kyle-wiggers/"}],"articleBody":"At its re:Invent 2024 conference in Las Vegas, Amazon on Sunday announced a somewhat unusual new service for Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers: Data Transfer Terminal, a set of physical locations where customers can plug in their storage devices to upload data to the AWS cloud. So how does it work, exactly? From the AWS management console, customers can reserve a time slot, optionally assign process and data transfer specialists from their organization, and visit a Data Transfer Terminal location to upload their data. &#8220;On your reserved date and time, [you&#8217;ll] visit the location and confirm access with the building reception,&#8221; Channy Yun, a principal developer advocate at AWS, explained in a blog post. &#8220;[You&#8217;ll then be] escorted by building staff to the floor and your reserved room of the Data Transfer Terminal location [&#8230;] Don’t be surprised if there are no AWS signs in the building or room. This is for security reasons to keep your work location as secret as possible.&#8221; The initial Data Transfer Terminal locations have been opened in New York City and Los Angeles, and more will be added in the future. Each location is equipped with a patch panel, fiber optic cable, and a PC for monitoring data transfer jobs. A pilot AWS Data Transfer Terminal location. Image Credits:AWS Now, why would someone want to lug all their hard drives to a building and sit around and wait for the upload to finish? Well, Amazon claims that Data Transfer Terminal delivers fast upload speeds (up to 400 Gbps) via a secure, &#8220;high throughput&#8221; connection. You&#8217;ll have to pay for the privilege, though. Amazon charges &#8220;per port hour&#8221; for usage of ports in Data Transfer Terminal locations during a reservation — even when no data is being transferred. &#8220;At a minimum, you&#8217;ll be charged per port hour for the number of hours reserved,&#8221; reads an Amazon support page. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be charged for port hours for each port you use and/or request as part of your reservation.&#8221; Techcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Ahead of the show&#8217;s official opening, AWS on Monday detailed a number of updates to its overall data center strategy that are worth paying attention to. The most important of these is that AWS will soon start using liquid cooling for its AI servers and other machines, regardless of whether those are based on its homegrown Trainium chips and Nvidia&#8217;s accelerators. Specifically, AWS notes that its Trainium2 chips (which are still in preview) and &#8220;rack-scale AI supercomputing solutions like NVIDIA GB200 NVL72&#8221; will be cooled this way. It&#8217;s worth highlighting that AWS stresses that these updated cooling systems can integrate both air and liquid cooling. After all, there are still plenty of other servers in the data centers that handle networking and storage, for example, that don&#8217;t require liquid cooling. &#8220;This flexible, multimodal cooling design allows AWS to provide maximum performance and efficiency at the lowest cost, whether running traditional workloads or AI models,&#8221; AWS explains. The company also announced that it is moving to more simplified electrical and mechanical designes for its servers and server racks. &#8220;AWS’s latest data center design improvements include simplified electrical distribution and mechanical systems, which enable infrastructure availability of 99.9999%. The simplified systems also reduce the potential number of racks that can be impacted by electrical issues by 89%,&#8221; the company notes in its announcement. In part, AWS is doing this by reducing the number of times the electricity gets converted on its way from the electrical network to the server. AWS didn&#8217;t provide many more details than that, but this likely means using DC power to run the servers and/or HVAC system and avoiding many of the AC-DC-AC conversion steps (with their default losses) otherwise necessary. “AWS continues to relentlessly innovate its infrastructure to build the most performant, resilient, secure, and sustainable cloud for customers worldwide,” said Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of Infrastructure Services at AWS, in Monday&#8217;s announcement. “These data center capabilities represent an important step forward with increased energy efficiency and flexible support for emerging workloads. But what is even more exciting is that they are designed to be modular, so that we are able to retrofit our existing infrastructure for liquid cooling and energy efficiency to power generative AI applications and lower our carbon footprint.” Techcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

AWS will also roll out its own control system across its electrical and mechanical devices in the data center, which will come with built-in telemetry services for real-time diagnostics and troubleshooting. “Data centers must evolve to meet AI’s transformative demands,” said Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and HPC at Nvidia. “By enabling advanced liquid cooling solutions, AI infrastructure can be efficiently cooled while minimizing energy use. Our work with AWS on their liquid cooling rack design will allow customers to run demanding AI workloads with exceptional performance and efficiency.”"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"The scene is set for AWS re:Invent 2024","url":"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/2923609/the-scene-is-set-for-aws-reinvent-2024/","mainEntityOfPage":"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/2923609/the-scene-is-set-for-aws-reinvent-2024/","datePublished":"2024-12-03T00:04:13+00:00","dateModified":"2024-12-03T00:04:14+00:00","publisher":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"author":[{"id":"https://techcrunch.com/author/morgan-little/#/schema/person/","@type":"Person","name":"Morgan Little","url":"https://techcrunch.com/author/morgan-little/"}],"articleBody":"Amazon&#8217;s largest enterprise event of the year is underway, and if you didn&#8217;t make it to Las Vegas this year, you still have options.

AWS re:Invent 2024 kicked off in Las Vegas on Sunday, with sessions scheduled to run through December 6. A keynote address featuring AWS CEO Matt Garman marks the start of today&#8217;s programming, starting at 8 a.m. PT sharp. AWS is putting together an archive of major keynotes and discussions on their YouTube channel, and we&#8217;ll be covering everything that&#8217;s announced onstage. Keep your eyes peeled for that, as well as for our stories popping up throughout the course of re:Invent. Notably, this is Garman&#8217;s first re:Invent as AWS&#8217; CEO. His predecessor, Adam Selipsky, stepped down in May after just three years at the helm. So what can we expect? Garman must deal with a market perception that&nbsp;AWS continues to trail&nbsp;Microsoft and Google in the generative AI race. AWS has introduced a number of generative AI services in recent months, and the company claims that its revenue from generative AI has reached &#8220;multiple billions&#8221; of dollars. In another win, AWS just weeks ago shored up its partnership with Anthropic by becoming the AI company&#8217;s primary model training partner and by agreeing to have Anthropic&#8217;s team help guide its future AI chip design efforts. But AWS has also faced setbacks, like the departure of top AI exec Matt Wood and delays of its flagship Olympus model.

These chips, which AWS first announced a year ago, will be four times as fast as their predecessors, with a single Trainium2-powered EC2 instance with 16 T2 chips providing up to 20.8 petaflops of compute performance. In practice, that means running inference for Meta&#8217;s massive Llama 405B model as part of Amazon&#8217;s Bedrock LLM platform will be able to offer &#8220;3x higher token-generation throughput compared to other available offerings by major cloud providers,&#8221; according to AWS. These new chips will also be deployed in what AWS calls the &#8220;EC2 Trn2 UltraServers.&#8221; These instances will feature 64 interconnected Trainium2 chips which can scale up to 83.2 peak petaflops of compute. An AWS spokesperson informed us that these performance numbers of 20.8 petaflops are for dense models and FP8 precision. The 83.2 petaflops value is for FP8 with sparse models.  Image Credits:AWS AWS notes that these UltraServers use a NeuronLink interconnect to link all of these Trainium chips. The company is working with Anthropic, the LLM provider AWS has put its (financial) bets on, to build a massive cluster of these UltraServers with &#8220;hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips&#8221; to train Anthropic&#8217;s models. This new cluster, AWS says, will be 5x as powerful (in terms of exaflops of compute) compared to the cluster Anthropic used to train its current generation of models and, AWS also notes, &#8220;is expected to be the world’s largest AI compute cluster reported to date.&#8221; Overall, those specs are an improvement over Nvidia&#8217;s current generation of GPUs, which remain in high demand and short supply. They are dwarfed, however, by what Nvidia has promised for its next-gen Blackwell chips (with up to 720 petaflops of FP8 performance in a rack with 72 Blackwell GPUs), which should arrive &#8212; after a bit of a delay &#8212; early next year. Image Credits:AWS Trainium3: 4x faster, coming in 2025 Maybe that&#8217;s why AWS also used this moment to immediately announce its next generation of chips, too, the Trainium3. For Trainium3, AWS expects another 4x performance gain for its UltraServers, for example, and it promises to deliver this next iteration, built on a 3-nanometer process, in late 2025. That&#8217;s a very fast release cycle, though it remains to be seen how long the Trainium3 chips will remain in preview and when they&#8217;ll also get into the hands of developers. Image Credits:TechCrunch “Trainium2 is the highest performing AWS chip created to date,” said David Brown, vice president of Compute and Networking at AWS, in the announcement. “And with models approaching trillions of parameters, we knew customers would need a novel approach to train and run those massive models. The new Trn2 UltraServers offer the fastest training and inference performance on AWS for the world’s largest models. And with our third-generation Trainium3 chips, we will enable customers to build bigger models faster and deliver superior real-time performance when deploying them.” Techcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Image Credits:TechCrunch Interestingly, AWS stresses that there is no database sharding involved here to scale the service &#8212; and that it can scale reads and writes independently. The company also highlights that Aurora DSQL will offer strong consistency, ensuring that if users opt for a multiregion approach, all regions will always show the same data at the same time. AWS notes that to ensure resiliency, Aurora DSQL uses an active-active architecture, meaning there is always a standby server ready to take over, which guarantees &#8220;that a customer&#8217;s application is always available by enabling an application to read and write to any Aurora DSQL endpoint.&#8221; Since this is a fully managed service, AWS handles all of the security updates and manages the overall infrastructure. Image Credits:TechCrunch To make all of this happen, the AWS team says it had to &#8220;reinvent relational database transaction processing.&#8221; Typically, ensuring strong consistency across multiple regions and having those globally distributed servers sync with what AWS describes as &#8220;microsecond accuracy&#8221; is a rather difficult feat to achieve. AWS says it can do this because it decoupled the transaction processing from the storage. Traditional methods, the company explains, would be bottlenecked by having to pass information back and forth multiple times. Aurora, however, only checks each transaction when it&#8217;s time to commit the changes and then, when the commit happens, it parallelizes those writes across regions. One nifty twist here: To make sure that each region sees the commits in the right order, Aurora DSQL uses the Amazon Time Sync Service, which adds very precise reference clocks to every EC2 instance and synchronizes them using the atomic clocks on GPS satellites. Image Credits:TechCrunch Having this exact time helps solve a number of data consistency issues and speeds up the processing. And while using a time-based approach may seem like a no-brainer, it takes very precise &#8212; and well-synchronized &#8212; clocks to do so. Synchronizing clocks, and doing so on a global scale, is a surprisingly difficult problem. That&#8217;s why traditionally, databases haven&#8217;t been able to use time in this way. Startups like Clockwork specialize in this. For a long time, that wasn&#8217;t actually possible, but now that these systems are available, they enable database innovations like this.

Announced at AWS&#8217; re:Invent 2024 conference in Las Vegas, the service, Automated Reasoning checks, validates a model&#8217;s responses by cross-referencing customer-supplied info for accuracy. (Yes, the word &#8220;checks&#8221; is lowercased.) AWS claims in a press release that Automated Reasoning checks is the &#8220;first&#8221; and &#8220;only&#8221; safeguard for hallucinations. But that&#8217;s, well&nbsp;… putting it generously. Automated Reasoning checks is nearly identical to the Correction feature Microsoft rolled out this summer, which also flags AI-generated text that might be factually wrong. Google also offers a tool in Vertex AI, its AI development platform, to let customers “ground” models by using data from third-party providers, their own datasets, or Google Search. In any case, Automated Reasoning checks, which is available through AWS&#8217; Bedrock model hosting service (specifically the Guardrails tool), attempts to figure out how a model arrived at an answer — and discern whether the answer is correct. Customers upload info to establish a ground truth of sorts, and Automated Reasoning checks creates rules that can then be refined and applied to a model. As a model generates responses, Automated Reasoning checks verifies them, and, in the event of a probable hallucination, draws on the ground truth for the right answer. It presents this answer alongside the likely mistruth so customers can see how far off-base the model might&#8217;ve been. AWS says PwC is already using Automated Reasoning checks to design AI assistants for its clients. And Swami Sivasubramanian, VP of AI and data at AWS, suggested that this type of tooling is exactly what&#8217;s attracting customers to Bedrock.

San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 REGISTER NOW &#8220;With the launch of these new capabilities,&#8221; he said in a statement, &#8220;we are innovating on behalf of customers to solve some of the top challenges that the entire industry is facing when moving generative AI applications to production.&#8221; Bedrock&#8217;s customer base grew by 4.7x in the last year to tens of thousands of customers, Sivasubramanian added. But as one expert told me this summer, trying to eliminate hallucinations from generative AI is like trying to eliminate hydrogen from water. AI models&nbsp;hallucinate because they don’t actually &#8220;know&#8221; anything. They’re statistical systems that identify patterns in a series of data, and predict which data comes next based on previously seen examples. It follows that a model’s responses aren’t answers, then, but predictions of how questions&nbsp;should&nbsp;be answered — within a margin of error. AWS claims that Automated Reasoning checks uses &#8220;logically accurate&#8221; and &#8220;verifiable reasoning&#8221; to arrive at its conclusions. But the company volunteered no data showing that the tool is reliable. In other Bedrock news, AWS this morning announced Model Distillation, a tool to transfer the capabilities of a large model (e.g., Llama 405B) to a small model (e.g., Llama&nbsp;8B) that&#8217;s cheaper and faster to run. An answer to Microsoft&#8217;s Distillation in Azure AI Foundry, Model Distillation provides a way to experiment with various models without breaking the bank, AWS says. Image Credits:Frederic Lardinois/TechCrunch &#8220;After the customer provides sample prompts, Amazon Bedrock will do all the work to generate responses and fine-tune the smaller model,&#8221; AWS explained in a blog post, &#8220;and it can even create more sample data, if needed, to complete the distillation process.&#8221; But there&#8217;s a few caveats. Model Distillation only works with Bedrock-hosted models from Anthropic and Meta at present. Customers have to select a large and small model from the same model &#8220;family&#8221; — the models can&#8217;t be from different providers. And distilled models will lose some accuracy — &#8220;less than 2%,&#8221; AWS claims. If none of that deters you, Model Distillation is now available in preview, along with Automated Reasoning checks. Also available in preview is &#8220;multi-agent collaboration,&#8221; a new Bedrock feature that lets customers assign AI to subtasks in a larger project. A part of Bedrock Agents, AWS&#8217; contribution to the AI agent craze, multi-agent collaboration provides tools to create and tune AI to things like reviewing financial records and assessing global trends. Customers can even designate a &#8220;supervisor agent&#8221; to break up and route tasks to the AIs automatically. The supervisor can &#8220;[give] specific agents access to the information they need to complete their work,&#8221; AWS says, and &#8220;[determine] what actions can be processed in parallel and which need details from other tasks before [an] agent can move forward.&#8221; &#8220;Once all of the specialized [AIs] complete their inputs, the supervisor agent [can pull] the information together [and] synthesize the results,&#8221; AWS wrote in the post. Sounds nifty. But as with all these features, we&#8217;ll have to see how well it works when deployed in the real world."},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"AWS and GitLab team up to bring Amazon Q agents to GitLab&#8217;s Duo Assistant","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/aws-and-gitlab-team-up-to-bring-amazon-q-agents-to-gitlabs-duo-assistant/","mainEntityOfPage":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/aws-and-gitlab-team-up-to-bring-amazon-q-agents-to-gitlabs-duo-assistant/","datePublished":"2024-12-03T18:04:57+00:00","dateModified":"2024-12-03T18:35:15+00:00","publisher":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","inLanguage":"en-US","@id":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/aws-and-gitlab-team-up-to-bring-amazon-q-agents-to-gitlabs-duo-assistant/#primaryimage","url":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PXL_20220520_112153305.jpg","contentUrl":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PXL_20220520_112153305.jpg","width":3260,"height":2454},"author":[{"id":"https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/#/schema/person/","@type":"Person","name":"Frederic Lardinois","url":"https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/"}],"articleBody":"GitLab, the popular developer and security platform, and AWS, the popular cloud computing and AI service, today announced that they have teamed up to combine GitLab&#8217;s Duo AI assistant with Amazon&#8217;s Q autonomous agents. The goal here, the two companies say, is to accelerate software innovation and developer productivity, and unlike so many partnerships in this business, this is actually a rather deep collaboration between these two companies. This includes joint engineering work to integrate the two platforms and a dedicated sales team. In practice, this means that GitLab users will now be able to use Duo&#8217;s chat feature to interact with Amazon Q Developer, which is now directly integrated into the GitLab chat UI. This means developers can now use Duo to access many of the agents available in Amazon Q Developer to help with code reviews, generate unit tests, and modernize their Java apps &#8212; or even plan and develop entire features in a multistep process. Leveraging Q, the two companies argue, will allow developers to stay in the flow (without having to maneuver the unwieldy AWS console), all while still getting the help of Q to kick off multistep tasks right from within GitLab. &#8220;To us, this is bringing together the best of both worlds: our deep knowledge of the [software development life cycle], with our unified data store, which becomes really powerful as part of AI &#8212; and the breadth of cloud technologies plus AI agents and services that AWS brings,&#8221; Ashley Kramer, GitLab&#8217;s CMSO and interim CRO, told me. &#8220;Being able to bring those together, our ultimate goal is to meet customers and future prospects where they are, and that&#8217;s often developing their code in GitLab and using the AWS Developer Console and services.&#8221; Kramer stressed that GitLab continues to work with a variety of other partners as well. This includes Google, which worked with GitLab to integrate it into its developer console, and model providers like Anthropic. But she also noted that she was especially excited about this AWS partnership, in large part because the two companies have so many joint customers. &#8220;We believe this will be the first step in a long, more integrated partnership,&#8221; Kramer said. &#8220;First step is integrating even more beyond the use cases [we] described, as far as one seamless interface, whether that&#8217;s GitLab&#8217;s interface, IDE, when it comes to GenAI and agentic AI, and then we&#8217;re looking into further services with AWS that we can integrate even more seamlessly as next steps in the partnership.&#8221; Techcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla — some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The focus here is on going beyond code completion and helping developers with a wider range of routine tasks involved in the end-to-end software life cycle. The service, which you may remember under its previous name of &#8220;CodeWhisperer,&#8221; is part of AWS&#8217;s overall Amazon Q generative AI platform, which also includes Q Business (and which is also getting a slew of updates today). &#8220;What developers need is they want to actually have Q be the buddy to solve some of the undifferentiated heavy lifting so that they can actually have more freedom to innovate,&#8221; Swaminathan &#8216;Swami&#8217; Sivasubramanian, AWS&#8217; VP of AI and Data, told me. &#8220;So that&#8217;s why having an assistant &#8212; or buddy &#8212; that helps them do things faster, more streamlined, is such an important thing, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re focused on it in a big way.&#8221; Managing the end-to-end software life cycle Sivasubramanian told me that he believes what differentiates Q Developer from competing platforms is its focus on the entire software development life cycle. So far that meant helping developers troubleshoot issues and perform multistep tasks to fix them (or build entirely new apps), as well as scan the code for security vulnerabilities. At re:Invent, the company is taking this a step further. Q can now, for example, automatically generate unit tests. But what&#8217;s maybe even more important is that it can now do the one thing that many developers hate the most: write and maintain the documentation for that code. To complete this cycle, Q can now generate a first code review when developers check in their code. Image Credits:TechCrunch &#8220;In Amazon, we have this rule that no code ever gets checked in without a code review,&#8221; Sivasubramanian said. &#8220;So if you don&#8217;t do a code review, then you cannot check in code. But not many enterprises actually have either enough senior engineers to review or the senior engineer says: &#8216;I can&#8217;t deal with so many reviews. Can somebody first review it before we do so?&#8217; Q will streamline the code review process by being the first line of reviewer and takes care of automatically checking code quality, security vulnerabilities, and so forth.&#8221; Then, once the code is in production, a new operations agent for Q can now automatically pull in data from AWS CloudWatch, the company&#8217;s monitoring service, and immediately start investigating when an alarm goes off. &#8220;It utilizes the [knowledge it has about an] organization&#8217;s AWS resources and then it sifts through hundreds of data points across various resources sitting in CloudWatch. Then, after analyzing it, Q comes up with potential hypothesis for the root cause and then it guides the users through how to fix it,&#8221; Sivasubramanian explained.

San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 REGISTER NOW All you wanted for Christmas was help with your Cobol and .NET migrations, right? For those enterprises with older codebases, transitioning to the cloud often involves rewriting a lot of their existing code. One of the earliest differentiating features of Amazon Q Developer was its agent for code transformation. At the time, the focus of this agent was on modernizing older Java apps. Today, the team is expanding this by also helping developers update their older .NET-based applications from Windows to Linux. Image Credits:TechCrunch And while this may at first seem like a curiosity, AWS is also launching an agent for modernizing COBOL mainframe applications. A lot of large enterprises still rely on this old code, after all, which few developers know to work with today. These are very complex migrations, Sivasubramanian stressed, and so the goal here is not to simply translate the existing code 1:1. &#8220;Our goal is not to actually just like fully COBOL project in, code out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The reality is, these projects are inherently extremely complex. You need to have a human in the loop to leverage it, but I&#8217;ve heard customers say, &#8216;Hey, this takes multiple years and customers have explicitly told us this is a game changer and would significantly drop that timeline.&#8221; Sivasubramanian noted that while there is less COBOL code to train models to automate the code migration, the team was able to leverage AWS&#8217; overall experience in modernizing mainframe applications, as well as more traditional methods for code translation. &#8220;Taking code from one language to another one arguably is the easy part,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the harder part is: how do you know you got it right? And how do you even know what the code does? And then the challenge in these [codebases] is they are usually poorly documented and dependencies are not well understood. So what we have built is really extremely innovative, and [the system] also understands, at a project level, what are the objectives of each of the module, and then plans out and creates a migration planning timeline to actually generate the code, and then generate the test &#8212; and bringing humans in the loop to see how you validate it.&#8221;"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Amazon&#8217;s Q Business AI agents get smarter","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/amazons-q-business-ai-agent-gets-smarter/","mainEntityOfPage":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/amazons-q-business-ai-agent-gets-smarter/","datePublished":"2024-12-03T18:30:00+00:00","dateModified":"2024-12-03T20:42:31+00:00","publisher":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","inLanguage":"en-US","@id":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/amazons-q-business-ai-agent-gets-smarter/#primaryimage","url":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-182660003.jpg","contentUrl":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-182660003.jpg","width":3456,"height":2304,"caption":"macro image of an"},"author":[{"id":"https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/#/schema/person/","@type":"Person","name":"Frederic Lardinois","url":"https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/"}],"articleBody":"A year ago, AWS announced Q, its AI assistant platform for business users and developers. Q Developer is getting a wide range of updates today and so is Q Business. The focus for Q Business is on new integrations that can help businesses bring in more data from third-party tools, the ability for third-party platforms to integrate Q into their own services, and new actions that will allow Q to perform tasks on behalf of its users across third-party applications like Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and Smartsheet, among others. More Q in QuickSight Previously, Q was already able to pull in data from about 40 enterprise tools ranging from data stores like Amazon&#8217;s own S3 to services like Google Drive, SharePoint, Zendesk, Box, and Jira. Q then creates a canonical index of all of this data (keeping access permissions and other settings intact). The idea now is to expand the types of data the service can index and then use that to provide ever more personalized results. This index, after all, is at the core of Q&#8217;s capabilities. Image Credits:TechCrunch Now businesses will be able to take the data they have stored in databases, data warehouses, and data lakes and combine it with the rest of their business data, be that documents, wikis, or emails &#8212; and they can now do so in QuickSight, AWS&#8217; business intelligence service. Amazon Q in QuickSight, the company says, will allow employees to query this data and quickly generate charts and graphs with the help of Q (or augment existing charts with content from a wider variety of sources). These new features are now in preview. More Q on third-party platforms The feature that is maybe the most interesting from a business perspective is that third-party services like Zoom, Asana, Miro, PagerDuty, Smartsheet, and others will now be able to integrate Amazon Q Business into their own services. These services will get access to an API that will allow their generative AI-powered experiences to access the same index that is also used by Q. Asana, for example, is integrating Q Business and Asana AI to help its customers find information from other third-party applications (that are indexed by Q) without having to leave Asana. And from there, they can kick off Q workflows and take actions in these third-party tools. Image Credits:TechCrunch Similary, Zoom will use the Q index to enhance its own AI assistant so that, for example, the Zoom AI Companion can transcribe and summarize a meeting while Q looks for relevant documents, email, or wiki entries related to the call.

San Francisco | October 27-29, 2025 REGISTER NOW AWS stresses that all of these features will only surface information that the users have permission to access. In this context, it is worth noting that others, including Atlassian&#8217;s Rovo, also heavily focus on third-party data integrations (Rovo offers about 80 or so connectors at this point). For many of them, including Atlassian, the idea is to keep users on their own platforms, though, not to have third-party services integrate their assistants and indexes. That&#8217;s an interesting play on AWS&#8217; part. More Q for more workflows Image Credits:TechCrunch The dream of productivity nerds has long been to automate more of the repetitive but hard-to-automate processes that are part and parcel of running a business. With this update, Q Business will now feature a library of more than 50 actions that Q can perform for them, but more importantly, AWS is going beyond the workflow-automation tools it already offered with Q. The service now uses generative AI so that users can simply describe a workflow using natural language or upload a document that describes a given process. They can also use a browser plugin to let Q capture how they perform an action step-by-step. Q Business then creates the agents that can perform and maintain this workflow. Image Credits:TechCrunch These workflows can run at specific intervals or be triggered by specific actions. The market for workflow automation is getting crowded with startups and incumbents like UiPath and Microsoft&#8217;s Power Automate. But it seems like the advent of generative AI may finally allow some of these products to live up to the promises of what was once called &#8220;robotic process automation.&#8221; Those systems were often too brittle in real-world usage, but generative AI now allows for a bit more flexibility in how these tools interact with third-party platforms.

While in previous years AWS has focused on greatly expanding SageMaker&#8217;s capabilities, this year, streamlining was the goal. At its re:Invent 2024 conference, AWS unveiled SageMaker Unified Studio, a single place to find and work with data from across an organization. SageMaker Unified Studio brings together tools from other AWS services, including the existing SageMaker Studio, to help customers discover, prepare, and process data to build models. &#8220;We are seeing a convergence of analytics and AI, with customers using data in increasingly interconnected ways,&#8221; Swami Sivasubramanian, VP of data and AI at AWS, said in a statement. &#8220;The next generation of SageMaker brings together capabilities to give customers all the tools they need for data processing, machine learning model development and training, and generative AI, directly within SageMaker.&#8221; Using SageMaker Unified Studio, customers can publish and share data, models, apps, and other artifacts with members of their team or broader org. The service exposes data security controls and adjustable permissions, as well as integrations with AWS&#8217; Bedrock model development platform. AI is built into SageMaker Unified Studio — to be specific, Q Developer, Amazon&#8217;s coding chatbot. In SageMaker Unified Studio, Q Developer can answer questions like &#8220;What data should I use to get a better idea of product sales?&#8221; or &#8220;Generate SQL to calculate total revenue by product category.&#8221; Explained AWS in a blog post: &#8220;Q Developer [can] support development tasks such as data discovery, coding, SQL generation, and data integration&#8221; in SageMaker Unified Studio.

But Amazon has partnered with Orbital, an AI startup, to test a new material that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere — and they’re using an AWS data center as a first site.&nbsp; One of carbon capture’s biggest costs is generating enough airflow so that the sorbent material can withdraw a meaningful amount of carbon dioxide. Data centers seem an obvious place to deploy such a technology since their cooling systems move massive amounts of air to keep thousands of servers running at optimal temperatures.&nbsp; Orbital Materials’ deal with AWS will reportedly place its material at a yet-unnamed data center, according to Reuters. The setup should remove more carbon dioxide than the electricity used by the data center would produce, and the extra cost of the material should be far less than the price of a carbon offset.  The startup specializes in using AI to design advanced materials; Orbital’s models can generate a range of possible materials, including for batteries, semiconductors, and other electronics. But for now, it’s specializing in carbon capture. The material that’s going to be used by AWS was designed specifically to work with the hot air coming out of data centers. The company declined to disclose further details about the proprietary compound. Orbital isn’t the first to pair carbon capture with data centers. Both Alphabet and Meta hold patents related to the technology, and startup 280 Earth is working on the problem as well. So why aren’t all new data centers equipped to capture carbon? For one, it’s not free. There’s the material cost, of course, and any filtration system will increase the resistance within the cooling system, increasing the amount of energy it needs to run. Then companies need to figure out what to do with the carbon they capture. All of that needs to cost less than carbon offsets that companies can buy on the open market.&nbsp; But if the cost is low enough, on-site carbon capture is appealing for several reasons. For one, there’s no middleman to take a cut, as is often the case in carbon markets. Plus, the amount of captured carbon is much easier to verify. And if data centers do end up capturing more carbon dioxide than they generate, Amazon and other companies can sell the credits themselves, turning the system into a profit center.

In the words of Editor Frederic Lardinois, who is on the ground in Las Vegas right in the midst of all things re:Invent 2024: &#8220;As far as re:Invent keynotes go, there was plenty of news, but the overall experience felt a bit disjointed, with AWS CEO Matt Garman going deep into the weeds of some new and existing services at the start. He was then upstaged by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announcing new foundation models — which was maybe the marquee moment of the event so far — only to then have to go back to announce updates to Amazon Q and SageMaker.&#8221; Those new models include four text generators, an image generation model and a video generation model, all of which follow the new Nova naming convention. “We’ve continued to work on our own frontier models,” Jassy said, “and those frontier models have made a tremendous amount of progress over the last four to five months. And we figured, if we were finding value out of them, you would probably find value out of them.” You can get the full rundown on each of the Nova models and their rollout plans here. The Nova reveal came amid some other Tuesday reveals, like updates to Q Developer, Amazon&#8217;s coding assistant platform competing directly with GitHub Copilot, and upgrades to Q Business AI agents to bring together data more swiftly from numerous third-party tools and platforms."},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"AWS brings third-party apps to its SageMaker AI platform","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/04/aws-brings-third-party-apps-to-its-sagemaker-ai-platform/","mainEntityOfPage":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/04/aws-brings-third-party-apps-to-its-sagemaker-ai-platform/","datePublished":"2024-12-04T16:51:13+00:00","dateModified":"2024-12-04T19:51:16+00:00","publisher":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","inLanguage":"en-US","@id":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/04/aws-brings-third-party-apps-to-its-sagemaker-ai-platform/#primaryimage","url":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-8.49.45AM.png","contentUrl":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-8.49.45AM.png","width":3350,"height":1834,"caption":"AWS SageMaker presentation"},"author":[{"id":"https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/#/schema/person/","@type":"Person","name":"Frederic Lardinois","url":"https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/"}],"articleBody":"SageMaker has long been AWS&#8217; fully managed platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning and generative AI models. Over time, however, an ecosystem of applications has sprung up around AI and ML models for performing tasks like managing experiments, evaluating model quality, and security. Those always lived outside of SageMaker and had to be managed separately, but now, at its annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, AWS is launching a first curated set of AI apps that will be fully managed and secured by the SageMaker team. Some of the early partners who are making their applications available in SageMaker are Comet, Deepchecks, Fiddler, and Lakera Guard. Image Credits:AWS &#8220;One thing that we&#8217;ve heard from customers is that, as they&#8217;re building out end-to-end AI solutions and workflows, oftentimes they want to use a purpose-built tool &#8212; a third-party tool &#8212; which they really like, and they want it to work really well with their SageMaker development environment. But today, what they have to do is they have to spend time and effort in integrating those third-party tools with the rest of the Sagemaker system,&#8221; Ankur Mehrotra, the director and GM for SageMaker at AWS, told me. Mehrotra also noted that many companies worry about the security implications of using a third-party tool since they don&#8217;t want their data to be shared with these additional services.

It&#8217;s no surprise, then, that at this year&#8217;s re:Invent, the company is announcing a number of updates to the platform, with a focus on making model training and fine-tuning on HyperPod more efficient and cost-effective for enterprises. HyperPod is now in use by companies like Salesforce, Thomson Reuters, and BMW and AI startups like Luma, Perplexity, Stability AI, and Hugging Face. It&#8217;s the needs of these customers that AWS is now addressing with today&#8217;s updates, Ankur Mehrotra, the GM in charge of HyperPod at AWS, told me. One of the challenges these companies face is that there often simply isn&#8217;t enough capacity for running their LLM training workloads. Image Credits:AWS &#8220;Oftentimes, because of high demand, capacity can be expensive as well as it can be hard to find capacity when you need it, how much you need, and exactly where you need it,&#8221; Mehrotra said. &#8220;Then, what may happen is you may find capacity in specific blocks, which may be split across time and also location. Customers may need to start at one place and then move their workload to another place and all that &#8212; and then also set up and reset their infrastructure to do that again and again.&#8221; To make this easier, AWS is launching what it calls &#8220;flexible training plans.&#8221; With this, HyperPod users can set a timeline and budget. Say they want to complete the training of a model within the next two months and expect to need 30 full days of training with a specific GPU type to achieve that. SageMaker HyperPod can then go out, find the best combination of capacity blocks, and create a plan to make this happen. SageMaker handles the infrastructure provisioning and runs the jobs (and pauses them when the capacity is not available). Image Credits:AWS Ideally, Mehrotra noted, this can help these businesses avoid overspending by overprovisioning servers for their training jobs. Many times, though, these businesses aren&#8217;t training models from scratch. Instead, they are fine-tuning models using their own data on top of open weight models and model architectures like Meta&#8217;s Llama. For them, the SageMaker team is launching HyperPod Recipes. These are benchmarked and optimized recipes for common architectures like Llama and Mistral that encapsulate the best practices for using these models.

Image Credits:AWS As the number of teams working with generative AI in a company grows, different teams will likely provision their own capacity, which in return means that some of those GPUs will sit idle and eat into a company&#8217;s overall AI budget. To combat this, AWS is now allowing enterprises to essentially pool those resources and create a central command center for allocating GPU capacity based on a project&#8217;s priority. The system can then allocate resources automatically as needed (or determined by the internal pecking order, which may not always be the same thing). Another capability this enables is for companies to use most of their allocation for running inference during the day to serve their customers and then allocate more of those resources to training during the night, when there is less demand for inferencing. As it turns out, AWS first built this capability for Amazon itself and the company saw the utilization of its cluster go to over 90% because of this new tool. &#8220;Organizations really want to innovate, and they have so many ideas. Generative AI is such a new technology. There are so many new ideas. And so they do run into these resource and budget constraints. So it&#8217;s about doing the work more efficiently and we can really help customers reduce costs &#8212; and this overall helps reduce costs by, we&#8217;ve looked at it, up to 40% for organizations.&#8221;"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"AWS brings prompt routing and caching to its Bedrock LLM service","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/04/aws-brings-prompt-routing-and-caching-to-its-bedrock-llm-service/","mainEntityOfPage":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/04/aws-brings-prompt-routing-and-caching-to-its-bedrock-llm-service/","datePublished":"2024-12-04T17:25:51+00:00","dateModified":"2024-12-04T18:41:16+00:00","publisher":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"sourceOrganization":{"@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#organization"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","inLanguage":"en-US","@id":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/04/aws-brings-prompt-routing-and-caching-to-its-bedrock-llm-service/#primaryimage","url":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-9.20.25AM.png","contentUrl":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-9.20.25AM.png","width":3350,"height":1834},"author":[{"id":"https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/#/schema/person/","@type":"Person","name":"Frederic Lardinois","url":"https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/"}],"articleBody":"As businesses move from trying out generative AI in limited prototypes to putting them into production, they are becoming increasingly price conscious. Using large language models (LLMs) isn&#8217;t cheap, after all. One way to reduce cost is to go back to an old concept: caching. Another is to route simpler queries to smaller, more cost-efficient models. At its re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, AWS on Wednesday announced both of these features for its Bedrock LLM hosting service. Let&#8217;s talk about the caching service first. &#8220;Say there is a document, and multiple people are asking questions on the same document. Every single time you&#8217;re paying,&#8221; Atul Deo, the director of product for Bedrock, told me. &#8220;And these context windows are getting longer and longer. For example, with Nova, we&#8217;re going to have 300k [tokens of] context and 2 million [tokens of] context. I think by next year, it could even go much higher.&#8221; Image Credits:AWS Caching essentially ensures that you don&#8217;t have to pay for the model to do repetitive work and reprocess the same (or substantially similar) queries over and over again. According to AWS, this can reduce cost by up to 90% but one additional by-product of this is also that the latency for getting an answer back from the model is significantly lower (AWS says by up to 85%). Adobe, which tested prompt caching for some of its generative AI applications on Bedrock, saw a 72% reduction in response time. The other major new feature is intelligent prompt routing for Bedrock. With this, Bedrock can automatically route prompts to different models in the same model family to help businesses strike the right balance between performance and cost. The system automatically predicts (using a small language model) how each model will perform for a given query and then route the request accordingly. Image Credits:AWS &#8220;Sometimes, my query could be very simple. Do I really need to send that query to the most capable model, which is extremely expensive and slow? Probably not. So basically, you want to create this notion of &#8216;Hey, at run time, based on the incoming prompt, send the right query to the right model,'&#8221; Deo explained. LLM routing isn&#8217;t a new concept, of course. Startups like Martian and a number of open source projects also tackle this, but AWS would likely argue that what differentiates its offering is that the router can intelligently direct queries without a lot of human input. But it&#8217;s also limited, in that it can only route queries to models in the same model family. In the long run, though, Deo told me, the team plans to expand this system and give users more customizability. Image Credits:AWS Lastly, AWS is also launching a new marketplace for Bedrock. The idea here, Deo said, is that while Amazon is partnering with many of the larger model providers, there are now hundreds of specialized models that may only have a few dedicated users. Since those customers are asking the company to support these, AWS is launching a marketplace for these models, where the only major difference is that users will have to provision and manage the capacity of their infrastructure themselves &#8212; something that Bedrock typically handles automatically. In total, AWS will offer about 100 of these emerging and specialized models, with more to come.

Another annual tradition now is that Vogels, who joined Amazon in 2004, publishes a series of predictions for the next year. It&#8217;d be easy to think that this year&#8217;s predictions are all about AI, but instead, Vogels focuses on how millennials and Gen Z think about being part of the workforce, nuclear energy, combating misinformation, open data for disaster preparedness, and the need for intention-driven technology. Unlike his employer, whose keynotes this week focused almost exclusively on AI, Vogels only mentions it three times in his written predictions &#8220;for 2025 and beyond.&#8221; And while AI is now a steady drone in the background, he seems to be more preoccupied with how technology in general is shaping the world right now. The next generation of employees &#8220;I&#8217;ve been very much interested in looking at companies that are interested in solving really hard human problems, really big problems, like economic equality, whether it&#8217;s food, healthcare globally,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;And with that whole &#8216;Now Go Build&#8217; documentary series, we&#8217;ve raised some of those. But one of the things that I&#8217;ve been noticing in the past, let&#8217;s say four or five years, is that there is a new generation of workers out there that are actually willing to take a pay cut if they can work for a company that has sustainability in mind — all these issues.&#8221; He also said that he has heard from a number of NGOs that there is a massive increase in tech workers who would like to volunteer at these organizations. &#8220;Where, in the past — five, ten years ago, you would have to beg for people to come. Now people knock on the door,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The problem that these companies have is how to manage them. They don&#8217;t actually have the people. An organization like Mercy Corps, for example, they only have two people that are in tech, right? Because that money goes to the area [where] they can actually have impact. They don&#8217;t go on the tech side. … Now they have an engineer for two weeks. They have all these great ideas that they want to do, and even companies that are coming to them saying: &#8216;Oh, you can have our products for free.&#8217; But they do not have the people to work on this.&#8221; Vogels believes — and I think a lot of people would back him up — that the next generation of workers will also bring this mindset to the companies they work for and that these companies will have to adapt to them. &#8220;That means as employers, if you&#8217;re interested in actually hiring the absolute best engineers, you better make sure that you change your company culture to actually be able to attract these people. It&#8217;s no longer: Do I get the best laptop? Do I get the best screen? Do I get two screens, right? But does my work matter? And that&#8217;s a really big shift, because it&#8217;s no longer about what&#8217;s the salary I&#8217;m getting? Because I&#8217;m willing to give up some of it if the work I&#8217;m doing means something right.

In that context, he also noted that one of his predictions for next year is about fighting misinformation and — within that context — supporting open source intelligence. &#8220;We have rapidly shifted from an era of prolonged news cycles that lasted weeks or months to a constant stream of updates that break at the speed of a click. Social media platforms have become a primary source for disseminating and consuming news, and it’s never been harder to distinguish between what’s true and false,&#8221; he writes in his prediction blog post. If technology brought us fake news, &#8220;then it&#8217;s also our responsibility as technologists to go the other way around to find solutions,&#8221; he told me. He believes that solutions like browser sidebars that display relevant context — and maybe academic research — about a given topic could be helpful, for example. &#8220;Elon is really going in time to push the story that media can&#8217;t be trusted,&#8221; Vogels said. &#8220;And since there&#8217;s many competing voices, can you trust the Washington Post and The New York Times and LA Times? Can you, or not? I mean, in the past, these used to be the source of truth. There was no discussion. If you were published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine, everybody in Germany would read that and know that that&#8217;s the truth. But can we help with technology? Is there a general perception, at least during the recent U.S. elections, that the general media can be trusted? At least one candidate is pushing that story very hard. Then we need to make sure that there is context around those stories that demonstrate which ones are telling the truth or not.&#8221; &#8220;If we look at X and sort of the community notes, I&#8217;m not really sure whether the community notes are terribly useful, but [they] should be. And the question is, can we automate these kinds of things?&#8221; Meanwhile, the organizations doing open source intelligence work, he said, are often not using the most advanced technology. He believes that locating where an image was taken, for example, should be automated by using image recognition. Similarly, he hopes that access to open data will help NGOs to improve their disaster preparedness by allowing them to build better maps in areas where commercial mapping isn&#8217;t financially viable, for example, or by building new real-time data sources for tracking wildfires. Fighting tech addiction Vogels also noted that one of the reasons technology has been such an accelerant for the spread of misinformation is because our devices and apps have become so addictive. &#8220;We have tremendous impact with our technology on the lives of people, not only in terms of whether we advocate for what&#8217;s the truth, but the amount of time we spend with technology,&#8221; he said. Applications today, he said, are essentially built to be sticky and addictive. &#8220;We as adults may be able to handle that,&#8221; he said (though I&#8217;ll interject here that I&#8217;m not sure if adults actually can). &#8220;You know, if your kid of four years old is sitting in the back of the car, and, you know, in the past, they will be singing or yammering: &#8216;Are we there? Are we there?&#8217; But [what] parents now do is just give them an iPad. Kids at four or five years old know how to use YouTube, but it also means that they get on a cycle of continuous highs, continuous highs, continuous highs. So the expectation is that these kids, and we already see that, are more prone to other types of addiction later as well, because you need to continuously get this next high whether it&#8217;s drugs, food, drinking, sex, or whatever.&#8221; People, he believes, are realizing this now and starting to take some action — maybe that&#8217;s using a dumb phone or going offline for extended periods. He noted that new regulations in Australia, which seek to ban kids under 16 from using social media, &#8220;is a pretty brute force approach, but it does signal a problem,&#8221; even if forbidding something to teenagers will make it more appealing, of course. &#8220;After all, you know, in the Netherlands [where cannabis has long been tolerated], a lot [fewer] kids continue to smoke weed because it wasn&#8217;t cool.&#8221; It&#8217;s up to technologists to ensure that their applications aren&#8217;t addictive — maybe by making the interfaces simpler, for example. &#8220;I mean, probably for TechCrunch, if somebody reads one article, you wanted them to read more articles. After all, page views equal income. It&#8217;s a business. But you know, how addictive do you make your interfaces, right? And yes, of course, as a company, you have a responsibility to shareholders to do that, but I think these days, we also have a social responsibility to make sure that our society is healthy enough in 10, 20 years from now that you can continue to be in business.&#8221; The nuclear option This year&#8217;s set of predictions is a bit &#8220;all over the place&#8221; (Vogels&#8217; words, not mine), and his next one is about the use of nuclear energy. In Vogels&#8217; view, the expansion of nuclear energy and the growth of renewable energy &#8220;will lay the groundwork for a future where our energy infrastructure is a catalyst for innovation, not a constraint.&#8221; &#8220;We know how to do small nuclear,&#8221; he told me — referring to the reactors used to power military submarines, for example. &#8220;We just never built them because they weren&#8217;t commercially interesting. Plus, society didn&#8217;t accept them as being [located] somewhere near them. If your submarine will go up in flame, fine, submarine, you chose for that. It&#8217;s a different story.&#8221; But we&#8217;ve now also reached a point where large businesses aren&#8217;t allowed to build new facilities near cities like Amsterdam, where Vogels lives, because the energy companies can&#8217;t deliver enough electricity to them anymore — not because they can&#8217;t generate enough. A few years ago, Vogels told me that he wasn&#8217;t ready to retire yet. I don&#8217;t get the sense that anything has changed for him. He&#8217;s clearly still enjoying his role — even if his predictions this year are a bit darker than usual."}],"dateModified":"2024-12-03T00:08:26+00:00"},{"@type":"VideoObject","@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/VideoObject/2924589","name":"AWS CEO Matt Garman speaks, with new models revealed","uploadDate":"2024-12-03T19:32:21+00:00","description":"AWS CEO Matt Garman's keynote has come to a close, but there's still plenty more to come from this year's re:Invent 2024 conference. In the words of Editor Frederic Lardinois, who is on the ground in Las Vegas right in the midst of all things re:Invent 2024: \"As far as re:Invent keynotes go, there was plenty of news, but the overall experience felt a bit disjointed, with AWS CEO Matt Garman going deep into the weeds of some new and existing services at the start. He was then upstaged by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announcing new foundation models — which was maybe the marquee moment of the event so far — only to then have to go back to announce updates to Amazon Q and SageMaker.\" Those new models include four text generators, an image generation model and a video generation model, all of which follow the new Nova naming convention. “We’ve continued to work on our own frontier models,” Jassy said, “and those frontier models have made a tremendous amount of progress over the last four to five months. And we figured, if we were finding value out of them, you would probably find value out of them.” You can get the full rundown on each of the Nova models and their rollout plans here. The Nova reveal came amid some other Tuesday reveals, like updates to Q Developer, Amazon's coding assistant platform competing directly with GitHub Copilot, and upgrades to Q Business AI agents to bring together data more swiftly from numerous third-party tools and platforms."},{"@type":"Person","@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/04204065a9b9e28aa844d71ca017751b","name":"Kyle Wiggers","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","inLanguage":"en-US","@id":"https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/0a66c0c4e7c38c0d41959c04054c729b","url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c444ee74e16b994683cd9c6497173dda?s=96&d=identicon&r=g","contentUrl":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c444ee74e16b994683cd9c6497173dda?s=96&d=identicon&r=g","caption":"Kyle Wiggers"},"description":"Kyle Wiggers was TechCrunch's AI Editor until June 2025.

<p id="speakable-summary" id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">AWS CEO Matt Garman&#8217;s keynote has come to a close, but there&#8217;s still plenty more to come from this year&#8217;s re:Invent 2024 conference. In the words of Editor Frederic Lardinois, who is on the ground in Las Vegas right in the midst of all things re:Invent 2024:</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;As far as re:Invent keynotes go, there was plenty of news, but the overall experience felt a bit disjointed, with AWS CEO Matt Garman going deep into the weeds of some new and existing services at the start. He was then upstaged by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announcing new foundation models — which was maybe the marquee moment of the event so far — only to then have to go back to announce updates to Amazon Q and SageMaker.&#8221;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Those new models include four text generators, an image generation model and a video generation model, all of which follow the new Nova naming convention. </p>

</div></figure>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“We’ve continued to work on our own frontier models,” Jassy said, “and those frontier models have made a tremendous amount of progress over the last four to five months.
